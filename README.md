minerGUI - by Clayton Johnson <email: wired420@gmail.com>

A Windows based GUI for command line based BitCoin miners.

Source was written using Visual Studio 2012 on the .NET 4.5 Platform. Source 
is freely available for personal use. If you wish to use it for your site/pool 
feel free to contact me. If you wish to have a custom version locked 
specifically to your site/pool also feel free to contact me. I can give these 
versions extra more secure features.

Also if you have a pool you would like added to the default version. Feel free to contact me.
