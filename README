minerGUI - by Clayton Johnson <email: wired420@gmail.com>

A Windows based GUI for command line based BitCoin miners.

Source was written using Visual Studio 2012 on the .NET 4.5 Platform. Source 
is freely available for personal use. If you wish to use it for your site/pool 
feel free to contact me. If you wish to have a custom version locked 
specifically to your site/pool also feel free to contact me. I can give these 
versions extra more secure features.

Also if you have a pool you would like added to the default version. Feel free 
to contact me.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN PRECOMPILED VERIONS:

1) Download bfgminer (http://www.bfgminer.com), and unzip it somewhere. 
   Anywhere will do but I’d make it somewhere easy to navigate to.

2) Download minerGUI (http://www.minergui.org). No need to unzip, 
   just place it directly on your desktop.

3) Run minerGUI.

4) Click the Set Miner button in the bottom left of the window that loads and set it to the directory you unzipped the miner to.

5) Enter your information (Currently only Slush’s pool is listed, but you can auto fill some boxes by going to Pools under Options)

6) Click Start.

That’s all there is to it. Screen shot doesn’t work when the GUI is the active window.

WHAT TO KNOW FOR COMPILING:

IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR WALLET SECURE. You must set a non-default salt. It's the first
variable in main.cs. You must also run it through the obsfuscator that comes with
visual studio. This should generally be enough to render most malware useless, and
make it hard enough to make it not worth someones time.

Do not come whine to me that my coding got your credentials stolen if you didn't
take these simple steps that consume less than 30 seconds.
